      ✅ Safe testing practices documented
      ✅ Production credential protection strategy clear
      ❌ CLIENT_ORIGIN missing from backend/.env.local (EXPECTED - part of implementation work)
  performance:
    status: PASS

# Story quality assessment
story_strengths:
  - "EXCEPTIONAL: Comprehensive configuration inventory (92% already configured)"
  - "EXCELLENT: Clear distinction between existing vs. needed configuration"
  - "EXCELLENT: Security considerations prioritized (Task 0 as P0)"
  - "EXCELLENT: Documentation-first approach"
  - "GOOD: Realistic scope (configuration only, no code changes)"
  - "100% requirements traceability coverage"

story_improvements_suggested:
  - "Clarify conflicting .gitignore status statements"
  - "Consistent terminology for missing configuration items"

# Validation approach summary
validation_strategy:
  type: "Manual verification with comprehensive checklists"
  rationale: "Appropriate for configuration story - automated tests not needed"
  integration_testing: "Task 5 provides comprehensive end-to-end verification"
  edge_cases_covered: "HTTPS optional, CLIENT_ORIGIN missing, production service safety"
