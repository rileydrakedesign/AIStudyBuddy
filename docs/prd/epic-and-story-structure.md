# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single comprehensive epic** with logically sequenced stories

**Rationale**:
This brownfield enhancement represents a **cohesive pre-beta refinement effort** rather than multiple unrelated features. All 6 enhancement themes share common goals (beta launch readiness, UX polish, production stability) and touch interconnected systems (RAG pipeline, UI components, auth flows).

A single epic approach provides:
- **Unified vision**: All stories contribute to "Production-Ready Beta Launch"
- **Dependency management**: Stories can reference shared infrastructure (logging, config, UI patterns)
- **Coherent release**: Beta launch happens when epic completes, not piecemeal
- **Team alignment**: Everyone works toward same milestone
