# Epic Summary

**Total Stories**: 9 stories sequenced for incremental delivery

**Story Dependencies**:
- 2.1 (Infrastructure) â†’ All stories (logging enables debugging)
- 2.2 (Auth) â†’ Independent (can run parallel with 2.3-2.4)
- 2.3 (RAG) â†’ 2.5 (Study Materials depend on citation fixes)
- 2.4 (Document Processing) â†’ 2.5 (Suggested queries, section metadata)
- 2.5 (Study Materials) â†’ 2.6 (Special formatting needs saved materials)
- 2.6 (UI/UX) â†’ 2.7 (Sidebar needed for summary toggle context)
- 2.7 (Document Viewer) â†’ Independent
- 2.8 (Routing & Rate Limiting) â†’ Independent (can run parallel)
- 2.9 (Beta Readiness) â†’ All stories complete (final validation)

**Estimated Timeline**: 5-6 weeks (assuming 2-person team, 1 frontend + 1 full-stack)
- Week 1: Stories 2.1, 2.2 (Infrastructure + Auth)
- Week 2: Stories 2.3, 2.8 (RAG improvements + Routing)
- Week 3: Story 2.4 (Document Processing - multi-format support)
- Week 4: Stories 2.5, 2.7 (Study Materials + Document Viewer)
- Week 5: Story 2.6 (UI/UX - high complexity)
- Week 6: Story 2.9 (Testing + Launch Prep)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Stories sequenced to enable early rollback (infrastructure first)
- Feature flags for high-risk items (LLM reranking, OCR)
- Comprehensive testing checklist in Story 2.9
- Phased deployment within each story (backend â†’ frontend)

**Critical Path**: 2.1 â†’ 2.3 â†’ 2.4 â†’ 2.5 â†’ 2.6 â†’ 2.9 (must complete in order)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 2.2, 2.7, 2.8 can run alongside critical path
