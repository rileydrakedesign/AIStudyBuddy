# Epic 2: Pre-Beta Production Readiness - Class Chat AI Enhancements

**Epic Goal**:
Deliver a polished, production-ready Class Chat AI MVP for beta launch with all critical bugs resolved, UX refined, RAG quality improved, authentication hardened, and infrastructure optimized for observability and scale.

**Integration Requirements**:
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing user data (no breaking schema changes)
- Deployment must follow phased approach (backend → low-risk frontend → high-risk frontend) to mitigate no-staging-environment risk
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact (regression testing focus)
- Feature flags required for high-risk features (LLM reranking, OCR) to enable rapid rollback

**Success Criteria**:
- All P0 (critical) and P1 (high) issues from ROUGH_FIXES.md resolved
- Beta launch checklist 100% complete (manual testing, Google OAuth verified, logs structured)
- No regressions in core flows (signup → upload → chat → citation → verification)
- Performance targets met (response times, ingestion times, UI interactions)

## Story 2.1: Infrastructure Foundation - Logging, Config, and Code Cleanup

As a **developer**,
I want **centralized configuration, improved logging, and clean codebase**,
so that **I can debug issues quickly during beta and maintain code quality**.

### Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Python service uses centralized `config.py` for all environment variables
2. Python logger captures all log levels (debug, info, warning, error) correctly
3. Node logger uses consistent structured format with improved readability
4. All log entries include `user_id` and `session_id` when available
5. Unused imports removed from backend (Node and Python)
6. Code linting identifies and fixes unused variables, dead code

**Integration Verification**:
1. Existing MongoDB connection continues to work with centralized config
2. Existing OpenAI API calls continue to work with config module
3. Log output is parseable by Heroku log aggregation (JSON format in production)
4. No performance degradation from logging changes

**Quality Requirements**:
5. Config module validates required env vars on startup and fails fast with clear errors
6. Log format includes timestamp, level, user_id, session_id, message (consistent structure)
7. Backend LOC reduced by at least 5% (removing dead code)

### Integration Verification

**IV1: Existing Functionality Verification**
- MongoDB queries execute successfully using `config.MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING`
- OpenAI embeddings and generation calls work using `config.OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Redis connection establishes using `config.REDIS_URL`

**IV2: Integration Point Verification**
- Heroku logs show structured JSON format in production environment
- Local development logs show pretty-printed format for readability
- All API endpoints log requests with user_id context (test with authenticated user)

**IV3: Performance Impact Verification**
- Baseline response time measured before changes
- Post-deployment response time within 5% of baseline (logging overhead negligible)
- Memory usage reduced due to removed imports (measure via Heroku metrics)

### Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create `config.py` as single source of truth, refactor all `os.getenv()` calls to import from config
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow architecture.md logging patterns (Pino for Node, Loguru for Python)
- **Key Constraints**: Must not break existing environment variable names (backward compatible)

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Centralized config module created and all services use it
- [ ] Python logger captures all levels, Node logger uses structured format
- [ ] User/session IDs present in 100% of relevant log entries
- [ ] Unused imports removed, code linting clean
- [ ] Deployed to Heroku, logs verified in production
- [ ] No regressions in existing API functionality

## Story 2.2: Authentication Hardening - Password Reset, Login Limiting, Delete Account

As a **user**,
I want **secure password reset, brute-force protection, and account deletion**,

4. Profile page password changes require current password validation
5. Email confirmation link auto-redirects to chat page on success

8. Account deletion removes all user data (user, classes, docs, chunks, S3 files)

**Integration Verification**:
1. Mailgun sends password reset emails successfully
2. Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour and are single-use only
3. Login attempt counter resets after 15 minutes
4. Deleted user email is blocked from re-registration

**Quality Requirements**:
5. Password reset tokens are cryptographically random (UUID v4)
6. Account deletion is atomic (all-or-nothing transaction)

  - Add `/api/v1/user/delete-account` endpoint with transaction logic
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow email verification pattern in `user_confirm.ts` for password reset
- **Rollback Considerations**: If account deletion fails midway, log error and mark account for manual cleanup

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Password reset flow end-to-end tested
- [ ] Login attempt limiting blocks after 5 failures, unblocks after 15 minutes
- [ ] Email change requires verification, old email receives notification
- [ ] Password change requires current password, validates strength
- [ ] Email confirmation auto-redirects to chat (desktop) or shows mobile message
- [ ] Delete account removes all data, verified in MongoDB + S3
- [ ] No regressions in existing auth flows
