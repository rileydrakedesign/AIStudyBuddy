Data Structures
3
• Scalars
• Vectors
• Matrices
• Data frames
• Lists
We will consider each of these in turn.
Data Types
4
logical (TRUE, FALSE)
integer (whole number)
numeric (real or decimal)
character (e.g, "a", “PSTAT")
complex (e.g, 1 + 0i, 1 + 4i)
SCALAR
• Scalars can hold only one value at a time.
• EXAMPLE (Numeric Scalar)

Vectors
6
Vectors in R are rows or columns of numbers or text.
In R we apply functions to vectors.
VECTORS
• Creating Vectors
❑ c()
❑ the colon operator
❑ seq()
❑ rep()
• sort()
7
CREATING A VECTOR
c()
• We can create a vector using the c() function.
• This function COMBINES its arguments to form a vector.
• It is called the COMBINE function.
• All the elements of a vector will be of the same type.

EXAMPLES OF VECTORS
# numeric vector
a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4)
# character vector
b <- c("one","two","three")
#logical vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)
length()
• The length of a vector refers to the number of elements it contains.

LECTURE 2 DEMO 1
Suppose we have test scores for 5 students Bob, Alice, Alex, Juan and
Amy. Their scores are 8,7,8,10,5 respectively.
1) Create a vector of these scores using the function c().
2) Find the mean score
3) Find the median score
4) Assign the name of each student to their test score

EXAMPLE
APPLYING FUNCTIONS TO VECTORS
Suppose you keep track of your mileage each time you fill up.
At your last 3 fill-ups your mileage was:
65311, 65624, 65908
How many miles did you drive between each fill up?
12
LECTURE 2 Demo 2 continued
New vectors can be created using existing vectors
We created the vector MILEAGE with the values:
65311, 65624, 65908
Suppose we now have another three mileages for the next 3 fill-ups
66200, 66533, 66856
Create a vector MILEAGE2 with these 3 mileages
Combine MILEAGE and MILEAGE2 into a vector named MILEAGE3
How many miles were covered between each fill up?

VECTORS (continued)
• What happens when we try to use the c() function to create a vector with
elements of different type?
• R determines a common vector type.
• This is called COERCION.
• Vectors are coerced to the simplest type required to represent all information.
• For example: vectors containing numeric elements AND character elements are
coerced to a character vector.

COERCION
• What happens when we create a vector containing both character
elements and numeric elements?
15
Creating a Vector
Using the COLON operator
• The COLON operator :
16
LECTURE 2 DEMO 4
Creating a Vector
Using the COLON operator
Using the colon operator, create a vector containing the
following elements 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
17
Lecture 2 DEMO 5
Create a vector using
seq()
SYNTAX
seq()
seq(from, to)
seq(from, to, by =, length =)
18
LECTURE 2 DEMO 6
Create a vector using the repetition function
rep()
• rep()
• Creates a vector of repeated values.
19
c()
colon operator
seq()
rep()
VECTORS
• Creating Vectors
– c()
– the colon operator
– seq()
– rep()
We now look at
i) how to sort the elements in a vector
ii) how to access elements in a vector.

LECTURE 2 DEMO 7
sort()
21
Create the following vector of test scores:
Test_Scores <- c(8,7,8,10,5)
Sort the test scores in increasing order
Sort the test scores in decreasing order
ACCESSING ELEMENTS OF A VECTOR
• Using the square bracket operator [ ]
• Name of Vector [ ]
• What’s in the square brackets?
22
LECTURE 2 DEMO 8
ACCESSING ELEMENTS OF A VECTOR
SUBSETS OF ELEMENTS OF A VECTOR
• Construct a vector x with elements 1,7,3,10,5.
• Write code to return the 4th element of x
• Write code to return every element of x except the 2nd

The objects command returns a listing of the objects currently in the
Global Environment.
> objects()
To remove an object from the Global Environment type:
> rm(object name)
To remove all objects from the Global Environment , click the broom in
the environment pane
